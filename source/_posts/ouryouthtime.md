## Quick Start
Some problem during my school project.
1.pip install meet error like: some error with error code 1 in xxx.eggg
solu: check the pip\pip install tool\etc ,make sure they stay fresh.
2.when execute the v-if in the vue template, ==is the correct!(some small details really matter
and the priority of v-for is higher than v-if when they are in the same class, TTS, program will exe in every v-for item and then check the condition of v-if.
